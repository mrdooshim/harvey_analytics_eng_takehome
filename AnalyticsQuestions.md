# Analytics Questions

_1. Based on your user_engagement model, how would you define a power user?_
A "power user" is someone with consistently high engagement in a given month. In this exercise, I categorized users by both # of active days and query volume in the month, where a user is labeled:
"Very Frequent"  if they submitted queries at least 13 days in the month (i.e. 3-4 days/week in a month); and
"Very High" if they submitted over 40 queries in the month

I would define a" "power" user as someone who falls into the top tiers of both â€“ engaging with the prodcut multiple times per week **_and_** submitting a high number of queries. This indicates the stickiness to the product and deep embeddedness into their workflow.

That said, it might also be helpful to look at job titles, e.g. set engagement thresholds more dynamic depending on the job titles or company size. Engagement expectations may vary depending on the role. For example, Junior Associates are viewed as more individual contributor levels and may be daily users while Partners might log in occasionally.

2. What potential issues or data quality concerns does the data surface? (These could be anomalies, missing data, inconsistent definitions, etc.)
